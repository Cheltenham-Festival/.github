There will be 28 races to enjoy, which began with the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle won by Rachael Blackmore on Slade Steel, as well as Willie Mullins’s State Man taking the Champion Hurdle, while Friday’s finale will feature the prestigious Cheltenham Gold Cup.

Galopin Des Champs will be looking to claim back-to-back wins in the showpiece Gold Cup, after the Champion Hurdle was thrown wide open following the withdrawal of heavy favourite and defending champion Constitution Hill, allowing State Man to take it.
